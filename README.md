## Examples and Use Cases

### Example 1: Supplier Risk Assessment

**Query**: "Identify potential risks in our current supplier network for electronic components, considering geopolitical factors and recent natural disasters."

**System Process**:
1. The system retrieves data on current suppliers, their locations, and historical performance from the Azure AI Search index.
2. It analyzes recent geopolitical events and natural disaster data that might affect these suppliers.
3. The OpenAI LLM processes this information to identify potential risks and their likelihood.
4. The RAG engine combines the retrieved data with the LLM's analysis to generate a comprehensive risk assessment.

**Response**: The system provides a risk analysis for the supplier network, including potential disruptions due to geopolitical tensions or natural disasters, alternative supplier recommendations, and suggested mitigation strategies.

### Example 2: Inventory Optimization

**Query**: "Optimize inventory levels for our automotive parts manufacturing plant, considering seasonal demand fluctuations and lead times from suppliers."

**System Process**:
1. Azure AI Search retrieves historical inventory data, seasonal demand patterns, and supplier lead times.
2. The system's predictive analytics module forecasts future demand based on historical patterns.
3. The LLM analyzes this information to suggest optimal inventory levels and reorder points.
4. The RAG engine combines all this information to generate detailed inventory optimization recommendations.

**Response**: The system provides recommended inventory levels for each automotive part, suggested reorder points, and potential cost savings. It also includes visualizations of demand forecasts and explanations for the recommendations.

### Example 3: Transportation Route Optimization

**Query**: "Identify the most efficient transportation routes for our global distribution network, considering current fuel prices, weather conditions, and port congestion."

**System Process**:
1. The system retrieves current distribution network data, including shipping routes, fuel prices, and port status.
2. It integrates real-time weather data and port congestion information.
3. The LLM processes this information to identify potential bottlenecks and opportunities for optimization.
4. The RAG engine combines the data-driven insights with the LLM's analysis to generate route optimization recommendations.

**Response**: The system provides optimized transportation routes, estimated cost savings, and projected delivery times. It also highlights potential risks (e.g., weather-related delays) and suggests alternative routes where necessary.

## Architecture

The solution consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Scripts (`scripts/data_preprocessing.py` and `scripts/index_data.py`) process and prepare supply chain datasets for indexing in Azure AI Search. This includes handling various data formats and sources common in supply chain management.

2. **Azure AI Search**: Indexes the processed supply chain data and provides fast, scalable search capabilities. This is managed through the `AzureSearchService` in `app/services/azure_search_service.py`.

3. **OpenAI LLM**: Processes natural language queries related to supply chain optimization and generates insights based on retrieved information. This functionality is encapsulated in `app/services/openai_service.py`.

4. **RAG Engine**: Combines retrieved search results with LLM-generated content for comprehensive supply chain analysis and optimization recommendations. This core logic is implemented in `app/services/rag_service.py`.

5. **Data Integration Service**: Handles real-time data updates from IoT devices, transportation systems, and inventory management systems, implemented in `app/services/data_integration_service.py`.

6. **Predictive Analytics Service**: Implements machine learning models for forecasting demand, identifying potential disruptions, and optimizing inventory levels, implemented in `app/services/predictive_analytics_service.py`.

7. **API Layer**: Provides endpoints for querying the system and retrieving supply chain optimization results, defined in `app/api/routes.py`.

8. **Web Interface**: (Optional) A user-friendly interface for supply chain managers to interact with the system, which can be built on top of the API layer.

The flow of a typical supply chain optimization query is as follows:

1. The user (supply chain manager) submits a query through the API or web interface.
2. The RAG service processes the query, first retrieving relevant supply chain data from Azure AI Search.
3. The Data Integration Service fetches any required real-time data from connected systems.
4. The Predictive Analytics Service generates forecasts or optimization suggestions based on historical and real-time data.
5. The retrieved data, real-time information, and predictive insights, along with the original query, are sent to the OpenAI service for analysis and generation of supply chain insights.
6. The RAG service combines all the information to create a comprehensive supply chain optimization response.
7. The response is returned to the user through the API, potentially with visualizations or additional data outputs.
